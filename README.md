Nachos Operating System

Nachos, is instructional software for teaching undergraduate, and potentially graduate level operating systems courses. It was developed at the University of California, Berkeley, designed by Thomas Anderson, and is used by numerous schools around the world.
Originally written in C++ for MIPS.

# Nachos - Synchronzation

Processes sometimes (in fact frequently) need to communicate with other processes. There needs to be a well-structured way for this communication to occur which does not rely on interrupts. There needs to be a well defined way of passing information between processes, coordinating process activity. There are three high level synchronization techniques which provide Synchronization. They are Semaphores, locks and Monitors & condition variables.

# Mechanisms:
1.	Caching: different cache block size can affect the runtime when integrated with other techniques (SIMD and superscalar mechanism)
2.	SIMD: Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD). It means performing a single operation on multiple data points simultaneously.
3.	Superscalar mechanisms: A superscalar processor executes more than one instruction 
during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to different components on the processor.
